# Hi, I'm Drilon 👋

I’m a Senior Mobile & Software Engineer with 14+ years of professional experience, primarily focused on Android, Flutter, and modern backend systems. I began my career during the early days of Android and have grown alongside the platform—adapting to new architectures, tooling, and engineering standards as the ecosystem evolved.

My work centers on building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready software, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, performance, and long-term sustainability.

## 🚀 About Me

My core expertise is Android development (14+ years), complemented by Flutter (6+ years) for cross-platform applications spanning Android, iOS, and Web. In recent years, I’ve expanded deeper into backend and infrastructure work, designing APIs and services using Node.js, Deno, and Go.

I value pragmatic engineering: choosing the simplest solution that scales, automating everything repeatable, and keeping systems understandable for the next engineer who touches them.

CI/CD, automation, and developer experience are integral parts of how I build and ship software.

## 💡 What I'm Passionate About

- **Mobile Application Development**: Android (Kotlin), Flutter (clean architecture, scalable state management).
- **Backend & Systems Development**: Go, Node.js, Deno — REST APIs, authentication, data persistence, performance-focused services.
- **CI/CD & Automation**: GitHub Actions, automated testing, release pipelines, internal tooling.
- **Software Architecture**: Designing systems that are easy to reason about, test, and evolve over time.
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with mobile, backend, and platform-level engineering trends.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Advanced Android architecture patterns and performance optimization.
- Scalable Flutter app structures for large, long-lived codebases.
- Go for high-performance backend services and tooling.
- API security fundamentals, rate limiting, and backend hardening.
- Practical applications of AI in real-world software products.
